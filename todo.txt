(1) Install Python38, Zoom, GitHub Desktop.
(2) Make accounts and share details of GitHub and Zoom.
(3) Introduce to git system, and share the learn repo.
(4) Hello World, Variables, how to use IDLE, pushing, pulling, basic logic, -+*/
(5) The three main structures of computer programming:
  a - SEQUENCES (Python sequentially runs steps in order that we ask it to)
  b - SELECTION (if, else, etc..)
  c - ITERATION (while, FOR i IN range(n))
(6) Breaking down problems into computable steps, DECOMPOSITION, ABSTRACTION, etc..
  For example, Brits like tea, so we make decompose the task of making a cup of tea into: GET cup, FILL kettle, while kettle boiling, put teabag in and retieve milk.
  This task includes all the three key programming concepts, we have SEQUENTIAL instruction: it would be bad if we put milk into cup before we had a cup. We have SELECTION,
  by saying "milk" OR "sugar" OR ("milk" AND "sugar"). We have ITERATION because we do while TEA =! boiled: DO x. Or, while teacup =! full, keep pouring.
(7) Datatypes: bools, strings, number, characters, etc..
(8) Data Structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.. (objects?)
(9) OOP - The idea of making functions, then dividing each element of a program into functions, then running them at the end, the benifits of this, etc..
(10) Them we make objects, classes, inheritance, instantiation, ohhhhh boyyy, we're in for a ride..

NOTE TO SELF: Rename this file "A crash coruse to learning python"
USE SCRATCH TO PRACTICE WITH FLOWCHARTS.
Then a ton of practice of various tasks.

(11) Depending on what her course is, we could to searching and sorting algorithms and share the good book by C&D about algorithms for ALEVEL.
